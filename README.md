  <p align="center">Simple initial project with MongoDB, NestJS for the BE and Angular for the FE creating a weather forecast web app.</p>
    <p align="center">

## Installation
Easier to handle in VS Code. Make sure MongoDB is already running on your machine. 
Just open the `app` and `server` folders individually, depending on the connection available and your prefered configuration navigate to the `constants` files and set the appropriate variables, then go to the terminal and execute

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running the app

In the Activity bar go to the `Run and Debug` option and execute the available option.

In the Database created the data in the following [file](https://openweathermap.org/storage/app/media/cities_list.xlsx) should be transformed into a `.csv` and then imported, make sure the `lon` column is a double.

Go to a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
